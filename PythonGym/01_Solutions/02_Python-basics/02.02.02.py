# Create two float variables named height and weight and assign them any values.
height = 1.75  # Replace with your actual height in meters
weight = 70.5  # Replace with your actual weight in kilograms

# Calculate and print the Body Mass Index (BMI).
bmi = weight / (height * height)
print("BMI:", bmi)
