# 2.1: Variables workout

## Exercise 2.1.1
###  Variable Declaration and Assignment

Write a program that declares three variables name, age, and city. Assign your name, age, and city to these variables, respectively. Print the values of these variables.

> *Hint:*
> - Use the function `print(...)` and the assignment operator `=`
> - Remember to enclose string data with `'` or `"` characters. 

## Exercise 2.1.2: Variable Reassignment

Write a program that declares a variable score and assigns a value of 80 to it. Print the value of score. Then, reassign a new value of 90 to score and print it again.

## Exercise 2.1.3: Numerical Operations

Write a program that declares two variables num1 and num2 and assigns them the values 10 and 5, respectively. Perform the following operations and print the results:

addition of num1 and num2
subtraction of num1 and num2
multiplication of num1 and num2
division of num1 by num2

## Exercise 2.1.4: String Operations

Declares two variables, name and age. Assigns your name to name and your age to age. Print the message: "My name is <name> and I am <age> years old."

> *Hint:*
>
> You can print several values with the `print`-function by putting several variables or raw data inside the parentasies, separated by `,`
>
> Like this: `print("Zip code: ", 4389)` 

## Exercise 2.1.5: String Concatenation

Write a program that declares two variables firstName and lastName and assigns your first name and last name to them, respectively. Concatenate firstName and lastName to form a full name and assign it to a new variable fullName. Print the value of fullName.

## Exercise 2.1.6: String formatting
Declare two string variables, firstName and lastName, with your first and last names. Concatenate firstName and lastName with a space in between to form your full name. Print the message: "Hello, my name is *fullName*." Use string formatting to insert the full name.

> *Hint*:
> 
> You can insert variables into a string by using string-formatting like this:

```python
street = "Skippergata"
number = "123"
formatted_string = f"Address: {street} {number}"
```
