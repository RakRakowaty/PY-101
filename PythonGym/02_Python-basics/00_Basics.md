# Warm up
Now we're getting started with the fun part! But before you working out your python muscles, let's get warmed up and familiar with the console and running basic python scripts.

## The Console
The console, also known as the terminal or command-line interface (CLI), is a text-based interface used to run commands, scripts, and manage files and directories. 

An interface is a bridge between the computer and the user. The console is a basic interface, that allows you to give the computer text based input and commands, and the computer can print out text based information to the user. Making a full graphical user interface (GUI) with windows, buttons and animations is a rather complex task. It's more user friendly, but you can achieve just as much with the console. 

All operating systems usually have a console interface, even though typical users only use the GUI on their devices. On Windows you can press `*winkey* + R` to open the run dialog, type in `cmd` and press enter. Now you will open a new console window.

Being a developer the console is your friend, allowing you to perform tasks more efficiently, running your beautiful scripts without the need to spend hours on making a GUI.


## Using the console
Let's start poking around in the console! 

- Assuming you are in Visual Studio code, go to ``Terminal -> New terminal``
- Now you will see a black window with some text below ⬇️. The text on the last line shows you the current working directory of the console.
- Try to type the command `dir` en press enter.
    - Now your computer should have printed a list of the files and subdirectories in the directory the console currently is working in. 
- Try to write `py --version`
    -   Now your computer will print the version of the currently selected python version on your computer, if it's installed correctly.
